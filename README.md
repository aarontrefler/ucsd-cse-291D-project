# Final Project for Latent Variable Models

## Project Abstract
In this project, we studied people’s decision making in mate selection using a
relatively large speed dating dataset from Kaggle.com. We built several models
relevant to this task, which are detailed throughout the report. Our most successful
model combined logistic regression and collaborative filtering to uncover hidden
structure laying behind people’s mate selection decisions. In the following report
we detail model construction, experimental results, as well as model evaluation.
